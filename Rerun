gh-actions-cache
sparkles A GitHub (gh) CLI extension to manage the GitHub Actions caches being used in a GitHub repository.

It enables listing of active caches in a repo along with capability to filter by cache key or branch. This brings transparency, for example by showing how much storage quota a cache is consuming or which branch a cache was created for etc or how recently was the cache used.

It also allows deleting a corrupt, incomplete or dangling cache. A cache can be deleted by cache key. The key can be easily found either using the list capability or by looking at the cache action log in workflow run logs.

This extension builds on top of cache management capabilities exposed by GitHub APIs.

Note: This extension currently supports github.com only, GitHub Enterprise Server is not supported currently.

	--key <string>				Filter by a key or key prefix
	--order <string>			Order of caches returned (asc/desc)
	--sort <string>				Sort fetched caches (last-used/size/created-at)


INHERITED FLAGS
	--help		Show help for command

	$ gh actions-cache list
	$ gh actions-cache list --key 564-node-a68c45df0f45f888039d32cd3a579992574e837406488e8904431197f20521d6
	$ gh actions-cache list --key 564-node-           // key prefix match
	$ gh actions-cache list -B main
	$ gh actions-cache list -B refs/pull/2/merge      // Use the full ref format for PR branches
	$ gh actions-cache list --limit 100
	$ gh actions-cache list --sort size --order desc  // biggest caches first
Delete
Deletes actions caches with specific cache key. It asks for confirmation before deletion.

USAGE:
	gh actions-cache delete <key> [flags]


ARGUMENTS:
	key		cache key which needs to be deleted

	
FLAGS:
	-R, --repo <[HOST/]owner/repo>		Select another repository using the [HOST/]OWNER/REPO format
	-B, --branch <string>			Delete caches specific to branch. Use the full ref format e.g. refs/heads/main
	--confirm				Confirm deletion without prompting


INHERITED FLAGS
	--help		Show help for command
        

EXAMPLES:

information_source There could be multiple caches in a repo with same key. This can happen when different caches with same key have been created for different branches. it may also happen if the version property of the cache is different which usually means that cache with same key was created for different OS or with different paths.
